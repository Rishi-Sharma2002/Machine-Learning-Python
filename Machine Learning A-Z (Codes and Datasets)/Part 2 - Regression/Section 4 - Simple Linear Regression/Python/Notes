What is Linear Regression?
Linear Regression:- It is a use to show predict relationship between 2 or more
                    factors. One is dependent and one is independent variable.

                    Equation representing Linear:
                    y = a1x + a0(which is similar to y=mx+c)
                    therefore it show representation in Linear Form.
                    where y is dependent variable and x is independent and
                    a1, a0 are the coefficient.

                    Example for deep understanding of Simple Linear Regression:-
                    Suppose if we want to find the total profit a company made
                    during the whole year.
                    To do so we need to find expenses and weight of expensis
                    like some expenses make more drastic effect in the total
                    profit some not, and sub profit during the project.
                    Here the sub project is
