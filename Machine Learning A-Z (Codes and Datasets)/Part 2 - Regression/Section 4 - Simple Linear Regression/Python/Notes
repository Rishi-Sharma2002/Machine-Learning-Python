What is Linear Regression?
Linear Regression:- It is a use to show predict relationship between 2 or more
                    factors. One is dependent and one is independent variable.

                    Equation representing Linear:
                    y = a1x + a0(which is similar to y=mx+c)
                    therefore it show representation in Linear Form.
                    where y is dependent variable and x is independent and
                    a1, a0 are the coefficient.

                    Example for deep understanding of Simple Linear Regression:-
